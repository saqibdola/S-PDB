# S-PDB

## Analysis and Classification of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Structures in PDB

### The datasets folder contains:

#### The AA, AAA and ASSE of protein structres of two types.  These datasets are used for classification. 


### The AA sequences of protein structures and DALI's results folder contains:

#### DALI results for the 6VSB structre in PDB90 (Dali 6vsbB-90.txt).

#### The AA sequences of two protein sturctues families: SARS-CoV-2 (SSARSAA.txt), Other S (SOthers.txt)
