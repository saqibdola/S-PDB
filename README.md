# S-PDB

## Analysis and Classification of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Structures in PDB

### The datasets folder contains:

#### The AA, AAA, ASSE and FAA of protein structres.  These datasets are used for classification. 


### The Protein Structrues AA Sequences folder contains:

#### DALI results for the 6VSB structre in PDB90 (Dali 6vsbB-90.txt).

#### The AA sequences of all protein structres (allproteinstructresAA.txt)

#### The AA sequences of three protein sturctues families: SSC2 (SSARSAA.txt), SO (Sothers.txt and O (Others.txt) 

#### The AA sequences of three protein sturctues families in SPMF format: SSC2 (SPMF SSARSAA.txt), SO (SPMF Sothers.txt and O (SPMF Others.txt)
